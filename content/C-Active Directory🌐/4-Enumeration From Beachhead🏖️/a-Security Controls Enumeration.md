Now that we have several credentials in hand from Password Spraying, we should now go ahead and enumerate Security Controls.

## Windows Defender

Windows Defender has greatly improved and most likely block tools such as PowerView.

There are ways to bypass these restrictions.

To obtain current Defender status:

```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> Get-MpComputerStatus

AMEngineVersion                 : 1.1.17400.5
AMProductVersion                : 4.10.14393.0
AMServiceEnabled                : True
AMServiceVersion                : 4.10.14393.0
AntispywareEnabled              : True
AntispywareSignatureAge         : 1
AntispywareSignatureLastUpdated : 9/2/2020 11:31:50 AM
AntispywareSignatureVersion     : 1.323.392.0
AntivirusEnabled                : True
AntivirusSignatureAge           : 1
AntivirusSignatureLastUpdated   : 9/2/2020 11:31:51 AM
AntivirusSignatureVersion       : 1.323.392.0
BehaviorMonitorEnabled          : False
ComputerID                      : 07D23A51-F83F-4651-B9ED-110FF2B83A9C
ComputerState                   : 0
FullScanAge                     : 4294967295
FullScanEndTime                 :
FullScanStartTime               :
IoavProtectionEnabled           : False
LastFullScanSource              : 0
LastQuickScanSource             : 2
NISEnabled                      : False
NISEngineVersion                : 0.0.0.0
NISSignatureAge                 : 4294967295
NISSignatureLastUpdated         :
NISSignatureVersion             : 0.0.0.0
OnAccessProtectionEnabled       : False
QuickScanAge                    : 0
QuickScanEndTime                : 9/3/2020 12:50:45 AM
QuickScanStartTime              : 9/3/2020 12:49:49 AM
RealTimeProtectionEnabled       : True
RealTimeScanDirection           : 0
PSComputerName                  :
```

We can see that `RealTimeProtectionEnabled` parameter is set to True, meaning Defender is enabled on the system.

## AppLocker

Application whitelist is a list of approved software applications or executables that are all allowed to run on system. 

**AppLocker** is a whitelisting solution and gives system admins control over which applications and files users can run.

It is common for organizations to block cmd.exe and PowerShell.exe and write access to certain directories but this can be all bypassed.

For example, organization often forgets about blocking PowerShell executable locations such as:

`%SystemRoot%\SysWOW64\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe` or `PowerShell_ISE.exe`

To get AppLocker Policy:

```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> Get-AppLockerPolicy -Effective | select -ExpandProperty RuleCollections

PathConditions      : {%SYSTEM32%\WINDOWSPOWERSHELL\V1.0\POWERSHELL.EXE}
PathExceptions      : {}
PublisherExceptions : {}
HashExceptions      : {}
Id                  : 3d57af4a-6cf8-4e5b-acfc-c2c2956061fa
Name                : Block PowerShell

UserOrGroupSid      : S-1-5-21-2974783224-3764228556-2640795941-513
Action              : Deny

PathConditions      : {%PROGRAMFILES%\*}
PathExceptions      : {}
PublisherExceptions : {}
HashExceptions      : {}
Id                  : 921cc481-6e17-4653-8f75-050b80acca20
Name                : (Default Rule) All files located in the Program Files folder
Description         : Allows members of the Everyone group to run applications that are located in the Program Files folder.
UserOrGroupSid      : S-1-1-0
Action              : Allow

PathConditions      : {%WINDIR%\*}
PathExceptions      : {}
PublisherExceptions : {}
HashExceptions      : {}
Id                  : a61c8b2c-a319-4cd0-9690-d2177cad7b51

UserOrGroupSid      : S-1-1-0
Action              : Allow

PathConditions      : {*}
PathExceptions      : {}
PublisherExceptions : {}
HashExceptions      : {}
Id                  : fd686d83-a829-4351-8ff4-27c7de5755d2
Name                : (Default Rule) All files
Description         : Allows members of the local Administrators group to run all applications.
UserOrGroupSid      : S-1-5-32-544
Action              : Allow
```

## PowerShell Constrained Language Mode

PowerShell Constrained Language Mode locks down many of the features needed to use PowerShell effectively. 

To tell whether if we are in full language more or Constrained language mode:

```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> $ExecutionContext.SessionState.LanguageMode

ConstrainedLanguage
```

## LAPS

LAPS (Local Administrator Password Solution)

Used for randomizing and rotating local administrator passwords on Windows hosts and prevent lateral movement. 

We can enumerate what domain users can read the LAPS password set for machines with LAPS installed and what machines do not have LAPS installed. 

[LAPSToolkit](https://github.com/leoloobeek/LAPSToolkit)could be used for the above purpose. 

[LAPSToolkit](https://github.com/leoloobeek/LAPSToolkit)provides features such as:

- Show groups delegated to read LAPS passwords.

Enumeration may show a user account that can read the LAPS password on a host. 

Using Find-LAPSDelegatedGroups:

```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> Find-LAPSDelegatedGroups

OrgUnit                                             Delegated Groups

```


`Find-AdmPwdExtendedRights` - Checks the rights on each computer with LAPS enabled for any groups with read access and users with "All Extended Rights".

Users with "'All Extended Rights" can read LAPS passwords and may be less protected than users in delegated groups.

Using Find-AdmPwdExtendedRights:

```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> Find-AdmPwdExtendedRights

ComputerName                Identity                    Reason
------------                --------                    ------
EXCHG01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL INLANEFREIGHT\Domain Admins Delegated
EXCHG01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL INLANEFREIGHT\LAPS Admins   Delegated
SQL01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL   INLANEFREIGHT\Domain Admins Delegated
SQL01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL   INLANEFREIGHT\LAPS Admins   Delegated
WS01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL    INLANEFREIGHT\Domain Admins Delegated
WS01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL    INLANEFREIGHT\LAPS Admins   Delegated
```

Using Get-LAPSComputers:

```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> Get-LAPSComputers

ComputerName                Password       Expiration

## Moving On

We have beachhead host compromised. 

Before moving on to different hosts, it is better to understand what protections are in place. 

Now let's move to further enumeration on the domain using the bechhead system.
