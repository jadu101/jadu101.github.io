**Affected Project**: QR Code Attendance System 1.0

**Official Website**: https://www.sourcecodester.com/php/17242/qr-code-attendance-system-using-php-and-mysql-source-code.html

**Version**: 1.0

**Related Code file**: delete-student.php

**Injection parameter**: student

## Vulnerability Description

The **student** parameter is vulnerable to the tested XSS payload: `%3cIMG%20%22%22%22%3e%3cSCRIPT%3ealert(%22XSS%22)%3c%2fSCRIPT%3e%22%3e`. This string is encoded and when decoded, it attempts to inject a script into the webpage:
`<IMG """"><SCRIPT>alert("XSS")</SCRIPT>">`

Application does not properly sanitize or validate the input, this script could be executed in the user's browser, leading to an XSS attack.

Payload used above is HTML encoded and decodes as `<IMG """><SCRIPT>alert("XSS")</SCRIPT>">`

Upon sending the modifying traffic containing XSS payload, we can verify the vulnerability:
