We can also find information about the installed plugins by reviewing the source code manually by inspecting the page source or filtering for the information using `cURL` and other command-line utilities.

To speed up enumeration, we could also write a simple bash script or use a tool such as `wfuzz` or `WPScan`, which automate the process.
