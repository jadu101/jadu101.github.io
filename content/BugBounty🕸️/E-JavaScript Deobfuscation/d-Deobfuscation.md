There are tools to beautify and deobfuscate the code automatically.

## Beautify

When the code is minified into single line JavaScirpt code, we need to `Beautify` it using tools such as `Browser Dev Tools`.

Go to Browser Dev Tools `Dbugger` and click on `{ }` button at the bottom to `Pretty Print` the script.

We can also use online tools like [Prettier](https://prettier.io/playground/) or [Beautifier](https://beautifier.io/)..

## Deobfuscate

We can use online tools such as [UnPacker](https://matthewfl.com/unPacker.html).

## Reverse Engineering

If the code was obfuscated using a custom obfuscation tool then we would need reverse engineering skill to understand how the code is obfuscated.
