**Authentication** - Process of verifying a claim that a system entity or system resource has a certain attribute value.

## Common Authentication Methods

Information technology systems can implement different authentication methods. Typically, they can be divided into the following three major categories:

- Knowledge-based authentication
- Ownership-based authentication
- Inherence-based authentication

### Knowledge

The user provides information such as passwords, passphrases, PINs, or answers to security questions.

### Ownership

The user proves their identity by proving the ownership of a physical object or device, such as ID cards, security tokens, or smartphones with authentication apps.

### Inherence

ThisÂ includes biometric factors such as fingerprints, facial patterns, and voice recognition, or signatures.
