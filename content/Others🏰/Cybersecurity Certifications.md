## Current Certs
I currently own [eJPT](https://certs.ine.com/15f24929-9acb-43e8-b36d-ddfe121b0cb6) and [PNPT](https://certified.tcm-sec.com/b8ee57b0-81e8-4098-853b-0e013bba7848). 

## Certs to Consider

- OSCP
- Maybe Cloud Related Cert

List of Certs to get before testing for OSCP
- CPTS
- CRTP
- CRTO
