Many web applications are set up with default credentials to allow accessing it after installation.

Many platforms provide lists of default credentials for a wide variety of web applications. Such an example is the web database maintained by [CIRT.net](https://www.cirt.net/passwords). For instance, if we identified a Cisco device during a penetration test, we can search the database for default credentials for Cisco devices.

Further resources include [SecLists Default Credentials](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/tree/master/Passwords/Default-Credentials) as well as the [SCADA](https://github.com/scadastrangelove/SCADAPASS/tree/master) GitHub repository which contains a list of default passwords for a variety of different vendors.
