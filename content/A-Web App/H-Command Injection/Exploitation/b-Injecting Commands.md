title: b-Injecting Commands

Let's say there is a `Host Checker` application where user can input an IP address and the back-end server will execute `ping -c 1 USER_INPUT`.

Instead of injecting IP address such as `127.0.0.1`, we can inject `127.0.0.1; whoami` to execute both original and injected command.

## AND Operator

Both the original and injected command gets executed:

```bash
ping -c 1 127.0.0.1 && whoami
```

## OR Operator

The `OR` operator only executes the second command if the first command fails to execute.

Below command will only execute the first command and ignore the `whoami` command:

```shell-session
21y4d@htb[/htb]$ ping -c 1 127.0.0.1 || whoami
```

However, below code will only execute `whoami` command since the first part of the command is broken:

```shell-session
21y4d@htb[/htb]$ ping -c 1 || whoami

ping: usage error: Destination address required
21y4d
```


Below is the list of the most common operators that can be used for injections:

|**Injection Type**|**Operators**|
|---|---|
|SQL Injection|`'` `,` `;` `--` `/* */`|
|Command Injection|`;` `&&`|
|LDAP Injection|`*` `(` `)` `&` `\|`|
|XPath Injection|`'` `or` `and` `not` `substring` `concat` `count`|
|OS Command Injection|`;` `&` `\|`|
|Code Injection|`'` `;` `--` `/* */` `$()` `${}` `#{}` `%{}` `^`|
|Directory Traversal/File Path Traversal|`../` `..\\` `%00`|
|Object Injection|`;` `&` `\|`|
|XQuery Injection|`'` `;` `--` `/* */`|
|Shellcode Injection|`\x` `\u` `%u` `%n`|
|Header Injection|`\n` `\r\n` `\t` `%0d` `%0a` `%09`|
