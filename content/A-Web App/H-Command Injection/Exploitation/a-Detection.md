## Command Injection Methods

To inject an additional command to the intended one, we may use any of the following operators:

| **Injection Operator** | **Injection Character** | **URL-Encoded Character** | **Executed Command**                       |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Semicolon              | `;`                     | `%3b`                     | Both                                       |
| New Line               | `\n`                    | `%0a`                     | Both                                       |
| Background             | `&`                     | `%26`                     | Both (second output generally shown first) |
| Pipe                   | `\|`                    | `%7c`                     | Both (only second output is shown)         |
| AND                    | `&&`                    | `%26%26`                  | Both (only if first succeeds)              |
| OR                     | `\|`                    | `%7c%7c`                  | Second (only if first fails)               |
| Sub-Shell              | ` `` `                  | `%60%60`                  | Both (Linux-only)                          |
| Sub-Shell              | `$()`                   | `%24%28%29`               | Both (Linux-only)                          |
|                        |                         |                           |                                            |

We can use the operators above to execute both or either original and injected code.
