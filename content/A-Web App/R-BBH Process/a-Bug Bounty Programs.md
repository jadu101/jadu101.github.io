## Types

`Private` 
- Needs invitation to participate. 
- Invitation usually comes from track record, valid finding frequency, and violation record.
- A representative example of this is how `HackerOne` deals with [invitations](https://docs.hackerone.com/hackers/invitations.html) based on specific criteria.

`Public`
- Accessible by the entire hacking community.


Something important to note is that the terms `Bug Bounty Program (BBP)` and `Vulnerability Disclosure Program (VDP)` should not be used interchangeably.

A vulnerability disclosure program only provides guidance on how an organization prefers receiving information on identified vulnerabilities by third parties. A bug bounty program incentivizes third parties to discover and report software bugs, and bug bounty hunters receive monetary rewards in return.

## Code of Conduct

Spend considerable time reading the code of conduct as it does not just establish expectations for behavior but also makes bug bounty hunters more effective and successful during their bug report submissions.

We strongly suggest that you go over [HackerOne's Code of Conduct](https://www.hacker101.com/resources/articles/code_of_conduct) to familiarize yourself with such documents.

## Structure

Organizations typically publish a vulnerability disclosure policy with guidance on how they want to receive information related to potential vulnerabilities in their products or online services. The policy also includes the program’s [scope](https://docs.hackerone.com/programs/defining-scope.html), which lists items hackers can test and send reports in for. It is often defined by the domain name for web applications or by the specific App Store / Play store mobile apps that a company builds.

A bug bounty program usually consists of the following elements:

| `Rewards`                       |                                                                                 |
