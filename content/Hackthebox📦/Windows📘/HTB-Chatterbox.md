**Chatterbox** was more like an Easy level Windows box. I first gained initial foothold by exploiting AChat server with Buffer Overflow. For privilege escalation, user alfred had full access to most of the directories in Administrator folder which I abuse to change permission for root.txt to read. 
## Information Gathering
### Rustscan

Rustscan finds several ports open including port 9255 and 9256 which is uncommon:

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(yoonã‰¿kali)-[~/Documents/htb/chatterbox]
â””â”€$ rustscan --addresses 10.10.10.74 --range 1-65535 
.----. .-. .-. .----..---.  .----. .---.   .--.  .-. .-.

### Nmap

Nmap script scan identifies AChat Chat system is running on port 9255:

```bash

## Enumeration
### SMB - TCP 445

I tried null login for SMB but it is not allowed:

Crackmapexec discovers computer name CHATTERBOX and that server is running on Windows 7 Professional:

### Achat - TCP 9256

It seems that AChat is vulnerable to Buffer Overflow:

## Shell as Alfred
### AChat Bufferoverflow


I will use [AChat-Reverse-TCP-Exploit](https://github.com/mpgn/AChat-Reverse-TCP-Exploit) that I found online.

Afer downloading both **AChat_payload.sh** and **AChat_Exploit.py** from the source above, I will first slightly modify AChat_payload.sh so that it will work with **nc**.

I can change the parameter `-p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp` to `-p windows/shell_reverse_tcp` to make it work with netcat.

After that, I will run it and input the correct value for RHOST, LHOST, and LPORT:

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jadu101/jadu101.github.io/v4/Images/htb/chatterbox/image-4.png)

I will copy the output and paste it into **AChat_Exploit.py** as such:

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jadu101/jadu101.github.io/v4/Images/htb/chatterbox/image-6.png)

I will also modify the target server address:

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jadu101/jadu101.github.io/v4/Images/htb/chatterbox/image-5.png)

Now I can run the exploit with netcat listener running:

On my local listern, I have a shell as Alfred:

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jadu101/jadu101.github.io/v4/Images/htb/chatterbox/image-8.png)

## Read root.txt

Running LinPEAS.exe found several interesting points.

AutoLogon credential for Alfred is discovered: **Welcome1!**

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jadu101/jadu101.github.io/v4/Images/htb/chatterbox/image-10.png)

It seems like Alfred got **AllAccess** to most of the Administrator directories:

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jadu101/jadu101.github.io/v4/Images/htb/chatterbox/image-11.png)

I can list the directories but I can't read the root.txt:

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jadu101/jadu101.github.io/v4/Images/htb/chatterbox/image-12.png)

I can easily bypass this by giving Alfred read permission:

`icacls "C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\root.txt" /grant Alfred:R`

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jadu101/jadu101.github.io/v4/Images/htb/chatterbox/image-13.png)

Now I can read root.txt.
